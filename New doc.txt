What is Risk Management and Why is it Important?
Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing and 
controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings. 
These risks stem from a variety of sources, including financial uncertainties, 
legal liabilities, technology issues, strategic management errors, accidents
 and natural disasters.
